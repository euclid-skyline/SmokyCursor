/**
 * SmokeWallpaperService is a live wallpaper service that simulates a dynamic, interactive smoke effect.
 *
 * This service employs a particle system to generate a visually engaging smoke-like animation.
 * User interactions through touch events significantly influence the smoke's behavior, creating an
 * immersive and responsive experience. The smoke particles are governed by physics-based rules,
 * exhibiting natural-looking movement, decay, and color transitions.
 *
 * ## Core Functionality:
 *
 * -   **Interactive Particle Generation:** Responds to user touches by spawning new smoke particles at the touch location.
 * -   **Physics-Driven Simulation:** Simulates physical phenomena like air resistance, buoyancy (float force), and random noise to achieve realistic particle motion.
 * -   **Dynamic Color Transition:** Smoothly transitions each particle's color from a vibrant orange to a deep blue hue over time.
 * -   **Organic Decay and Fading:** Particles gradually shrink in size and fade out in opacity as they age, mimicking the dissipation of real smoke.
 * -   **Optimized Rendering:** Employs coroutines for smooth, frame-by-frame animation updates and efficient rendering.
 * -   **Customizable Behavior:** Offers a wide array of tunable parameters, allowing for adjustments to particle count, physics properties, color schemes, and more.
 *
 * ## Implementation Details:
 *
 * -   **Wallpaper Engine:** Extends `WallpaperService` and implements a custom `SmokeEngine` as its rendering engine.
 * -   **Coroutine-Based Animation:** `SmokeEngine` utilizes coroutines for asynchronous task management, particularly for the animation loop and fade-out sequences.
 * -   **Particle System:** Manages a collection of `Particle` objects, each representing a single puff of smoke.
 * -   **Touch Interaction:** Processes touch events (`ACTION_DOWN`, `ACTION_MOVE`, `ACTION_UP`, `ACTION_CANCEL`) to dynamically control particle generation and behavior.
 * -   **Canvas Drawing:** Leverages Android's `Canvas` API to draw particles onto the wallpaper surface.
 * - **Physics simulation** Simulate `airResistance`, `noise`, `buoyancy` and `rotation`.
 * - **Size and decay management** Manage the particle size and its decay rate.
 * - **Fade out system** Allow to fade out particles using a coroutine.

         * - `launch` is a coroutine builder that creates a new coroutine.

         * - This method is typically called when the component/view becomes visible and needs to start animating/drawing.
         * - It's crucial to have a counterpart method to cancel this job when the view is no longer visible to prevent resource leaks.
         *
         * **Preconditions:**
         * - The `launch` coroutine builder must be available in the current scope (e.g., within a CoroutineScope).
         * - `isVisible` flag should be set appropriately to determine whether drawing is needed.
         * - `drawFrame()` method must be defined and correctly implement the frame rendering logic.
         *
         * **Post-conditions:**
         * - A new coroutine job is started and assigned to `drawJob`.
         * - If `isVisible` is true, `drawFrame()` will be called repeatedly with approximately 60 FPS.
         * - If a previous `drawJob` existed, it will be cancelled before the new job starts.
         *
         * **Side Effects:**
         * - Modifies the `drawJob` variable.
         * - Potentially triggers frequent calls to `drawFrame()`, which could have other side effects depending on its implementation.

         * @param currentTime The current time in milliseconds, used for noise generation.

         * **Physics Updates:**
         * - **Air Resistance:** The particle's velocity in both x and y directions
         *   is reduced by a factor based on `airResistance` and the `sizeEffect`.
         *   Larger particles experience slightly less resistance.
         * - **Noise Influence:** Perlin noise is sampled based on the particle's
         *   position and current time, adding a chaotic influence to the particle's
         *   velocity. Smaller particles are more heavily influenced by the noise.
         * - **Position Update:** The particle's x and y coordinates are updated based
         *   on its velocity. The y-coordinate also considers a `floatForce`, which
         *   simulates buoyancy, pushing the particle upwards. Smaller particles
         *   experience a larger float force.
         * - **Rotation Update:** The particle's rotation is updated based on its
         *   `rotationSpeed`. Larger particles rotate slower than smaller ones.
         *
         * **Size and Decay Updates:**
         * - **Base Decay:** The particle's decay rate (`baseDecay`) is determined

         * Calculates the alpha value for a given particle based on its age and predefined durations.

         * This function determines the opacity of a particle, taking into account a color transition
         * duration and a fade-out duration.  The particle's alpha decreases over time during the fade-out phase.
         *
         * @param p The Particle object for which to calculate the alpha value.
         *          It contains the particle's current age (p.age) and its initial alpha value (p.alpha).
         * @return An integer representing the calculated alpha value for the particle, ranging from 0 to 255 (inclusive).
         *         The alpha value decreases as the particle progresses through the fade-out phase.
         *
         * Algorithm:
         * 1. **Calculate Fade Progress:**
         *    - If the particle's age (`p.age`) is greater than the `colorTransitionDuration`, the particle is in the fade-out phase.
         *    - The `fadeProgress` is calculated as the ratio of the time spent in the fade-out phase (`p.age - colorTransitionDuration`)
         *      to the total `fadeOutDuration`.
         *    - The `fadeProgress` is then clamped between 0.0 and 1.0 using `coerceIn(0f, 1f)`. This ensures the progress never goes below 0 or above 1.
         *    - If the particle's age is less than or equal to `colorTransitionDuration`, it's not in the fade-out phase, and `fadeProgress` is 0.
         * 2. **Calculate Final Alpha:**
         *    - The `finalAlpha` is calculated by reducing the particle's initial alpha (`p.alpha`) based on the `fadeProgress`.
         *    - The formula used is `p.alpha * (1 - fadeProgress)`.
         *    - If `fadeProgress` is 0 (not in fade-out), the `finalAlpha` will be the same as the initial alpha.
         *    - If `fadeProgress` is 1 (fully faded out), the `finalAlpha` will be 0.
         *    - Values between 0 and 1 reduce the final Alpha proportionally
         * 3. **Return Final Alpha:**
         *    - The calculated `finalAlpha` is cast to an integer and returned.

         * **Fade-Out Process Breakdown:**
         *
         * 1. **Concurrency Management (Cancellation):**
         *    - If a fade-out coroutine (`fadeOutJob`) is currently running, it is immediately canceled. This prevents multiple fade-out sequences from overlapping and interfering with each other, ensuring a clean and predictable visual transition.
         *
         * 2. **Initialization (Progress Reset):**
         *    - The `fadeOutProgress` is reset to 1.0. This sets the starting point of the fade to fully opaque, guaranteeing a consistent starting state for each fade-out, regardless of any previous fade operations.
         *
         * 3. **Coroutine Launch (Animation Execution):**
         *    - A new coroutine is launched using the `launch` function. This coroutine is responsible for executing the fade-out animation asynchronously, allowing other tasks to continue running in parallel.
         *    - The coroutine will continue to run, updating the fade until the `fadeOutProgress` reaches or falls below 0.0.
         *
         * 4. **Time Tracking (Animation Timing):**
         *    - `startTime` is recorded as the current system time when the coroutine begins. This timestamp serves as the reference point for calculating the elapsed time during the animation.
         *    - In each iteration of the animation loop, `elapsed` time (the time passed since `startTime`) is calculated. This is used to determine how far along the fade-out animation is.
         *
         * 5. **Progress Calculation and Update (Opacity Adjustment):**
         *    - The `fadeOutProgress` value is updated in each frame of the animation loop based on the `elapsed` time.
         *    - The formula `1 - (elapsed.toFloat() / fadeOutDuration)` is used to calculate the current fade progress.
         *       - `elapsed`: Represents the time elapsed since the fade-out started.
         *       - `fadeOutDuration`: Represents the total duration of the fade-out animation.
